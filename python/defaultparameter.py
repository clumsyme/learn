    Actually, this is not a design flaw, and it is not because of internals, or performance.
    It comes simply from the fact that functions in Python are first-class objects, and not only a piece of code.

    As soon as you get to think into this way, then it completely makes sense: a function is an object 
    being evaluated on its definition; default parameters are kind of "member data" 
    and therefore their state may change from one call to the other - exactly as in any other object.

    In any case, Effbot has a very nice explanation of the reasons for this behavior in Default Parameter Values in Python.
    I found it very clear, and I really suggest reading it for a better knowledge of how function objects work.
"""
    
    """Default parameter values are evaluated when the function definition is executed. """

# OR:
#     When we define a function, at the momente it is defined, the default parameters is a ref to a certain
#     position of memory(we call it the init memory).
#     so 
#         def f(i=5)
#     or
#         def g(li=[])
#     the i ref to a certain memory, so does the li.
#     Everytime the function is called, it looks for that memory(the init memory).

#     But as we see, when we operate a int object or something unmutable, as i = i+1,
#     we are creating a new i ref to a new memory,so the origin memory value is unchanged.
#     The next time we call the function, it looks for the init memory and the value is still unchange.

#     The other way, unlike int, we all know that when we operate list, it DOES NOT creat a new object in memory
#     to link the ref, it just modify the value in init memory.So, as long as we do li.append(1), the init memory
#     vaule will change, the next time the function is called, the default value is nolonger the init value.

#     It may lead us to mistake when we do not relize it, but we can take advantage of it also.
#     The fib function below use recursion has a large cost, as there's lot's of repeat calculations.
        def fib(n):
            if n<2:
                return n
            else:
                return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
#     This can be potimized by store calculated value in a dict, so repeat calculations will be replaced as 
#     dict lookups.As below:

#     ##### HERE IS THE MEMOIZE VERSION OF FIB: #####
        def fib(n, values = {}):
            if n<2:
                return n
            try:
                result = values[n]
            except:
                values[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
                result = values[n]
            return result

#        which will be more readable by this:
        def fib(n, values = {}):
	        if n<2:
		        values[n] = n
	        else:
		        if n not in values:
			        values[n] = fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
	        return values[n]


#     # THIS efficiently reduce recursion repeat calculations, but still has a dict stored in memory.
#     # SO, it's still not as good as the iter one which is:
          def fib(n):
              a,b = 0,1
              for i in range(n):
                  a,b = b,a+b
              return a

# --------------------------------
    def mutable(var=[]):

	    var.append(1)       # modify it.

#     >>> mutable([2])
#     58296904    # no-use default value, id of var is not the init one.
#     58296904    # still, after modified, it's id remain the begining of the call.
#     >>> mutable()
#     58295048    # we use default value to call it again, it does use the init id and remain unchanged.
#     58295048    #

# ----------------------------------
    def unmutable(var=1):
	    print(id(var))
	    var += 1
	    print(id(var))

#     >>> unmutable()

#     >>> unmatable(2)
#     1515979248  # not init one.
#     1515979280  still changed.
#     >>> unmutable()
#     1515979216  # init one.
#     1515979248  # changed.
#     -----------------------------------
#     BUT another side, we know after
#         list = list+b
#     id(list) is changed,so the following is different from mutable():

    def mutorno(var=[]):
	    print(id(var))
	    var = var+[1]
	    print(id(var))
#     >>> mutorno()
#     58963016
#     58963208    # id DOES CHANGED.
#     >>> mutorno([2])
#     58353800
#     58963144
#     >>> mutorno()
#     58963016
#     58360008
#     this function will return [1] every time insteed [1]\[1,1]\[1,1,1]... in the mutable().
#     WHY?Because every call does not change the value of init memory, so every call with d-value get same value.
#     While mutable() does change the value of init memory, so every call with d-value get non-same value.

# In factï¼Œ if we can find out the value in memory, we would know it better.
# Luckly, the ctype module provide a function for us to know the value in 
# memory with a id of ID.

"""
The above content makes confusion that whether python is pass-by-value or pass-by reference?
If it's pass-by-reference, the following code will make i==2,
    i=1
    def f(obj):
        obj += 1
    f(i)
    i--->1
or if it's pass-by-value, the following code will not change li,
    li = []
    def g(obj):
        li += [1]
    g(li)
    li--->[1]
In pluent python p229 Luciano, the author, says para-pass in python is call by sharing, which means obj is now a sharing reference of i/li now.
But in python int or str type is unmutable so every modify of this type will create a new object and make the obj the new object's
reference. And for mutable objects, obj and li are all reference to the original object, anyone's change will make the other change.

Well this behaves just like JavaScript while it's said JS is all pass-by-value, the reason why Objects will be changed in function is
that the value of a Object variable is the object's address, so 
    var dog = new Dog()
    function doSome(obj){...}
    doSome(dog)
will pass dog's value which is dog object's address and make obj and dog all reference of the object.
They behave the same, just different names, as long as we know how exactly they work.
Seems we may also call JavaScript is call-by-sharing which is said by the answer of "Is JavaScript a pass-by-reference or pass-by-value language?"
from "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/518000/is-javascript-a-pass-by-reference-or-pass-by-value-language/3638034#3638034".
But JavaScript is actually pass-by-value, it just behave like call-by-sharing in python.
i.e
In python:
def f(a):pass
f(b) make b and a ref to the same object but if b is unmutable a+=1 in f will make a ref to another object.
In JS:
function f(x){}
f(y) pass y's value to x, if y is a basic type a new obj equal to y is passed to x, if y is a ref type y's value is object's address and x will also be the obj's ref.
